The companions, lost in a library of arcane knowledge, explore ancient love spells and enchantments. Valarie and Jasper discuss the possibility of love being a form of magic, while Elena discovers a sorceress's wisdom on dispelling potent spells. As the group finds an incantation to break enchantments, they feel a renewed hope and make a pact to continue their quest for answers together. The Moonlit Mansion, a silent witness to their trials, holds hidden truths that will only reveal themselves to those who defy the enchantment and unlock the mysteries of their hearts.
