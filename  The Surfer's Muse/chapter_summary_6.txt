Chapter 6: Globetrotting  

Chloe’s new job as a surfing photographer takes her around the world to exotic locations like Bali, Hawaii, Australia and beyond. Though her career is taking off exponentially, Chloe remains deeply unhappy without Kai in her life. Her heart is still in Maui though her work requires constant travel.  

While in Bali, Chloe struggles to find inspiration amid the picturesque surfing spots. Her photos lack the passion and heart of those she took of Kai. She realizes no landscape or subject can replace the man who still owns her heart. Memories of their passionate night together continue to haunt Chloe, a bitter reminder of what she left behind to follow her dreams.  

A photo shoot in Australia poses challenges as Chloe battles loneliness and longing. Surrounded by natural beauty and adventure, she can’t escape the hollow, sinking feeling that plagues her. The work that was once a creative outlet now feels draining and mundane. Her clients and colleagues remain unaware of her inner turmoil, expecting her usual vibrant and whimsical style. Chloe works to plaster on a smile and push through each day, finding little solace in the evenings.

While on a rare break in her hometown of Chicago, Chloe’s friends confront her about seeming unhappy and unfulfilled. They see beyond her social media posts glamorizing the globetrotting lifestyle and sense her unhappiness. Chloe finally opens up about missing Kai and wondering if she made a mistake leaving Maui behind. Her friends remind her it’s never too late to follow her heart. 

Chloe realizes she must return to Maui and Kai before it’s too late, even if it means jeopardizing the career she worked so hard to build. The reward of rekindling their connection and finding true happiness outweighs any material success. Her love for photography means little without someone to share the adventures with. Chloe books a flight to Maui, hoping Kai will welcome her back with open arms and a second chance at the love and life she longs for. She prepares to lay her heart on the line, this time refusing to let anything come between them again.
