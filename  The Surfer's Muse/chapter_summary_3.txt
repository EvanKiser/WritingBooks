 Here is a summary for Chapter 3 of the erotic novel in about 1000 words:

Chloe woke up to the sounds of the ocean outside her hotel window. The crashing of the waves reminded her of the passionate sounds she and Kai had made the night before. A smile crept across her face as she recalled their chance encounter on the beach, the instant chemistry over dinner and drinks, and the shared intimacy that followed. 

Though Chloe knew a fling while on vacation was cliche, something about Kai felt different. Behind his carefree surfer persona, she sensed a tenderness in the way he looked at her, touched her, and listened when she spoke. And the physical connection they shared was unlike anything she'd experienced before - raw yet romantic, wild yet deeply intimate. For the first time in years, Chloe felt desired and cherished.  

Chloe and Kai had agreed the night before to meet for breakfast. Though part of her wanted to keep things casual, Chloe couldn't deny her growing feelings for Kai. She hoped their time together this morning would reveal if the spark between them was more than just physical attraction.

Over pancakes and coffee, the conversation flowed effortlessly between Chloe and Kai. They discussed their common interests in nature and adventure, their life dreams, and the experiences that shaped them. The more they shared, the more Chloe felt a genuine bond forming. It seemed Kai felt the same way.

"I don't usually connect with someone like this, especially someone I just met," Kai admitted. "But there's something special about you, Chloe. I want to keep seeing you while you're here in Maui."

Chloe's heart swelled at his words. "I'd like that too," she replied with a smile.

They spent the rest of Chloe's vacation stealing kisses, walking hand in hand, watching the sunset, and making love. With each embrace, their passion and affection for one another grew. Chloe knew without a doubt she was falling for Kai.

On her last day, Chloe and Kai shared a tearful goodbye, unsure of when they might see each other again. Though sad to part, Chloe left Maui with a full heart, her creative spirit reawakened, and a memory she would forever cherish - the passionate night she and Kai shared where this unexpected love story began.
