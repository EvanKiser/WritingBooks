 Here is a summary of Chapter 4 of the erotic novel in 1000 words:

Chloe awakes the morning after her passionate night with Kai feeling excited yet uncertain of what comes next. The chemistry between them was undeniable, but she knows a holiday fling is all it can be as her life is in Chicago while Kai's world revolves around the ocean in Maui. 

Chloe goes through the motions of her usual beach photography, but her mind keeps drifting to memories of Kai's touch, his smile, the way he made her feel. She worries she's setting herself up for heartbreak, yet she yearns to see him again. As if sensing her longing, Kai appears for an evening surf as Chloe is shooting the sunset. Her heart leaps as she snaps photo after photo of him flawlessly riding the waves.

They share another romantic night together, even more passionate than the first. Chloe feels herself falling for this charming yet mysterious man and wishes she could freeze time to stay in this paradise with him forever. The next morning, Chloe reviews the photos from the previous evening and gasps - the images of Kai surfing as the sun dipped below the horizon are some of the most striking in her portfolio. She posts a few of the photos online, hoping to gain some local exposure.

Within hours, Chloe's photos explode across social media. Her website crashes under the flood of visitors hoping to see more of her work. By the next morning, her photos of Kai have gone viral, gaining over 50,000 likes and shares across platforms.
      
Her phone rings off the hook with calls from major media outlets, international surfing brands and stock photo agencies all clamoring to work with the 'hot new surf photographer'. One of the leading surfwear companies offers Chloe the opportunity of a lifetime - a contract to travel to exotic surfing destinations around the world to photograph their latest campaigns.

Chloe is stunned by her sudden success but also heartbroken at the prospect of leaving Maui - and leaving Kai. She meets with him that evening to share the unexpected news. While Kai is thrilled for her big break, the sorrow in his eyes mirrors how she feels inside. He holds her close one last time under the stars and whispers that she must follow this opportunity, as her talent and passion deserve to be shared with the world.  

Chloe's final days in Maui pass in a blur of conflicting emotions. She photographs Kai for one last dawn shoot, capturing his free spirit and love for the waves. At the airport, she clings to him not wanting to say goodbye, but he gently pushes her toward her departing flight with a kiss and his blessing to chase her dreams. 

As the island fades from view, tears flow down Chloe's cheeks. An exciting new adventure may await, but she knows a piece of her heart will always remain in Maui - and with the charming surfer who captured it.
