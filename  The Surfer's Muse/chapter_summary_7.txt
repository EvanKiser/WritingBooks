 Here is a summary for Chapter 7 of the erotic novel in about 1000 words:

Chloe sighed as she looked out the window of yet another hotel room in yet another city she was visiting for her job. Although her career as a surf photographer was thriving and she was living out her dream of traveling the world, she felt unfulfilled without Kai by her side. Her heart remained in Maui where she left him over a year ago, even as her work took her everywhere else.  

On a bright, early morning, Chloe's assistant knocked on her door, reminding her they had an early shoot scheduled with some of Australia's top surfers at Bondi Beach. Chloe dragged herself out of bed and got ready for the shoot, putting on a smile to hide her inner turmoil. At the beach, she easily fell into her routine, capturing dramatic shots of surfers riding waves and wiping out, the golden sunlight glinting off the turquoise water. Her assistant was pleased with the results, but Chloe felt detached from her work. Her passion for photography seemed to have faded without Kai as her muse and inspiration.

That evening, Chloe made an impulsive decision. She booked a flight back to Maui, determined to win Kai back. She realized that while her career was important, it meant nothing without someone to share her success and travels with. Her love for Kai ran deeper than any ocean, and she couldn't imagine continuing this nomadic lifestyle without him by her side.

A few days later, Chloe arrived in Maui, her heart pounding as she made her way to Kai's beachfront surf shack. But when Kai opened the door, she was shocked to see another woman by his side - a pretty local girl who worked as an instructor at Kai's surf school. Chloe's heart shattered as Kai stammered an introduction, the other woman gazing up at him adoringly. 

Chloe fled from the shack, tears streaming down her face as the truth hit her - Kai had moved on, and she was too late. Her impulsive decision and grand gesture blew up in her face, leaving her more lost than ever. She wandered aimlessly until finding herself on the beach where she first spotted Kai riding the waves. As night fell, Chloe sat alone in the sand and sobbed, wondering how she could have been so foolish to think Kai would wait for her when she left him without a second glance. Her career success meant nothing if she had no one to share the joy of her travels and accomplishments. 

Chloe realized with painful clarity that her passion for life had disappeared the moment she said goodbye to Kai. But she couldn't undo the hurt she caused him or turn back time. All she could do was pick up the pieces of her shattered heart and try to forge a new path forward - one without the man she loved more than her dream of adventure and escape. Her impulsive trip to win Kai back only caused more damage, and now Chloe questioned whether her globetrotting lifestyle was worth the sacrifice of true happiness and companionship. She fell asleep alone on the beach, the crashing waves echoing the turmoil in her heart.
