 Here is a 800-word summary of Chapter 8:

Chloe had been traveling the world for her surf photography job for over a year now, visiting exotic locales and capturing dramatic shots of surfers riding giant waves. But despite the glamour and adventure, she felt unfulfilled. Her heart remained in Maui, with Kai.  

On a rare week off, Chloe decided to return to Maui to see Kai again. She hoped that maybe, with time apart, his fears of commitment had lessened and he'd be willing to give their relationship another chance. After the long flight, she drove straight to his surf school on the beach, her heart pounding. 

Kai was giving a lesson to a group of beginners, demonstrating how to paddle and pop up on the board. Chloe watched from the sand, memories of their passionate first encounter flooding her mind. Kai looked as handsome as ever, his sun-bleached hair and tanned, toned body glistening with saltwater as he coached his students with patience and encouragement.  

When the lesson ended, Kai noticed Chloe and walked over, a mix of emotions on his face. "I didn't expect to see you here," he said, tension in his voice. Chloe swallowed hard, suddenly anxious. "I know. I hope it's okay I stopped by. I was in Maui for work and wanted to say hello."

Kai nodded, shoving his hands in the pockets of his board shorts. An awkward silence lingered until he finally spoke again. "It's good to see you. You look like you're doing well." Chloe sensed his guard was up. She decided to be honest about why she came. 

"Kai, the truth is...I haven't stopped thinking about you since we said goodbye. I know we only shared one night together, but it was unforgettable. My work has taken me everywhere, yet I've never felt as inspired and alive as I did here, with you." She stepped closer, her eyes searching his. "I came back hoping we might have a second chance."

Kai looked away with a pained expression. "Chloe...you know how I feel about you. But my life is here. Yours is out there, traveling the world. I don't want to hold you back from living your dreams." His voice broke as he added, "Or have my heart broken again when you leave."

Chloe's eyes filled with tears. She touched his cheek, turning him back to face her. "My dreams mean nothing without you in them. I've been given this gift of traveling and sharing my passion with others, but it's not what fulfills me. You do." She took a shaky breath, baring her vulnerable heart. "I love you, Kai. I want to build a life together, here in Maui. If you'll have me."

Kai was stunned. He searched Chloe's eyes, moved by her emotional honesty and declaration of love. His fears and doubts began to melt away in the warmth of her presence. Cupping her face, he leaned in and kissed her tenderly. When their lips parted, he smiled, brushing a tear from her cheek. 

"I love you too, Chloe. You're the missing piece of my soul, and home is wherever you are." Chloe threw her arms around him, overjoyed at his words. Kai held her close, realizing their paths had crossed again so they could walk side by side from this day on, into a future bright with promise.
