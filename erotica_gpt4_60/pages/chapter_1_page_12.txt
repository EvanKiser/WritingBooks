Elspeth and Cordelia, fueled by their unyielding love and the promise of a new life together, carefully navigated through the estate's gardens, the first light of dawn painting the world in vibrant hues of pink and orange. The fragrant aroma of roses and jasmine wafted through the air, adding to the undeniable allure of the young morning. As their escape reached its crucial moments, the drumming of their hearts mirrored the rhythm of their swift footsteps.

"Elspeth, we are almost to the stables," Cordelia whispered, her voice carrying a blend of hope and apprehension. "Do you have any notion of which horses might carry us away the fastest?"

Elspeth, deep in thought, recalled her late father's fascination with horse breeding, a hobby he had shared with her during her childhood. Remembering his wise words about the subtle differences between horses, she replied, "Yes, my love, I believe I know which horses we should choose. My father taught me much about such creatures, and I am confident I can select the swiftest among them."

As they arrived at the stables, the smell of hay and leather filled their nostrils, and the gentle sounds of the horses greeted their ears. Upon entering the dimly lit stable, Elspeth identified the two horses that she believed would be their best option - a strong, black stallion named Thunder and a majestic, white mare called Lightning. The pair of horses, once the pride of Elspeth's father, were known for their exceptional speed and endurance.

Cordelia looked at the magnificent animals in awe, feeling a surge of hope swell within her heart. "Elspeth, my love, I trust your judgment," she said, her eyes shining with admiration. "Let us ready Thunder and Lightning and make haste toward our new future."

Together, they prepared the horses with practiced ease, the excitement of their daring escape pulsing through their veins. As they finished, they shared a tender glance, a silent exchange that conveyed their shared apprehension and hope for the future.

"My love, our journey will be long and fraught with danger," Elspeth murmured, her hand tenderly caressing Cordelia's cheek. "But I know that together, we shall face whatever trials come our way, borne by the strength of our love."

Cordelia leaned into Elspeth's touch, her eyes filled with tears. "As long as I am with you, Elspeth, I fear nothing. Your love is the beacon that guides me through the storm, and together, we shall navigate the uncharted waters of our destiny."

With their horses prepared, and their hearts intertwined, Elspeth and Cordelia mounted Thunder and Lightning, feeling the powerful muscles beneath them as the horses waited, eager to be set free. The sun continued its ascent, casting a warm glow upon the two lovers as they prepared to leave the world they knew behind forever.

With a final look at the estate that had once been their prison, they let out a shared breath, their eyes meeting in a shared moment of understanding. Then, with a gentle nudge, they urged their horses into a gallop, the thundering sound of hooves echoing their determination to forge a new life together, unbound by the shackles of society's cruel judgment.
